<h1>Python Port Scanner</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a Python port scanner that allows users to scan for open ports on a remote host. The script takes a user input for the remote host and scans all ports between 1 and 65535 using a thread pool to enable the scanning of multiple ports at once. Once the scan is completed, the script outputs the list of open ports and the time it took to complete the scan. This script is designed for network administrators or security experts who want to ensure that their network is secure by identifying and securing open ports.
